# Weather App

I built this app as side project to help me get more grasp on [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for my startup idea.

The app uses the [Geolocation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation.html#content) Polyfill to retrieve the location coordinates (latitude, longitude) and load the weather data from [Open Weather Map Api](https://http://openweathermap.org/api) using the same coordinates

The color schemes can be added in [the themes file](https://github.com/zakhttp/weather-app/blob/master/src/components/colorThemes.js)

The actual theme is defined in the state variable 'theme'.

I included in the repo the initial [sketches snaps](https://github.com/zakhttp/weather-app/tree/master/resources/sketches) and the [sketch file](https://github.com/zakhttp/weather-app/blob/master/resources/sketches/weather.sketch) as well.

Please let me know your feedback, if any and feel free to modify it or use as base for your own projects.
